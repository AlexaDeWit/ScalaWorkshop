# Getting Started With Scala and Functional Programming

## What is this thing?

This is a repository that contains both documentation on how to get started with scala,
as well as a near empty project that has a configured build tool, and dependencies that will support
serving http requests, as well as json serialization support.

This workshop will involve playing around with creating a JSON API in Scala as a means
to illustrate functional programming principles in practice, as well as show the benefits
one can garner from the sort of type-level programming that is common in this paradigm.

Where many may be used to a programming paradigm centred around actions being taken, 
and state mutating as a response to inputs, we will instead try to think and model
a program instead in terms of functions taking immutable data and returning immutable results.

Another important part of this will be the idea of Pure and Total functions.

## But why though?

- Letting the compiler do as much work as possible is pretty cool. After all, what can never be null never needs a null check!
- Data Sharing: In this programming paradigm, we use immutable values to contain state. Thanks to this, we can use a concurrency model that relies heavily on shared access to resources.... Without -ever- needing locks, or mutexes, and without ever having a race condition. *(Except things that are below our level of abstraction as must always forever be so, such as a database-connection-level lock on a specific row)*
- Correctness:
- Reasonability: Once one is familiar with functional syntax, something like
 `List(1,2,3,4).map(_ * 2)`
 becomes much easier to read than the old imperative approach of
 ```
 var nums = new List{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };
 public List<int> doubleNums(List<int> nums) {
    var accumulator = new List<int>();
    foreach(var i in nums) {
        accumulator.Add(i * 2);
    }
    return accumulator;
 }

 ``` 
 - And while I recognize that the above example is fairly contrived, and not what one would do
 in the context of C# with LINQ.... The important thing here is that... When you use the LINQ approach
 you are using a subset of the techniques and approaches we will discuss here. As I am sure you all know,
 LINQ -is- functional programming. At least, some of it ;)
 - A bunch of other reasons including maintainability, referential transparency, and all sorts of stuff, but you already probably know some of the benfits if this workshop interests you. 

## Step One: Get the tools.

### Windows

- [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html)
- The build automation tool: [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html). Make sure that you add it to your `$PATH`
- Set your JAVA_HOME environment variable: [confluence](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/setting-the-java_home-variable-in-windows-8895.html)
- You will need an editor. I highly recommend Intellij's [IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwru2stDU1wIV3cqyCh1ZSQCzEAAYASABEgIRbvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds.ds&dclid=CLjSu97Q1NcCFVGTGAodGz0OnA#section=windows). *Seriously, trust me on this, if you want something intellisense-likey, there's almost no other option for an editor.*
- Install the Scala/SBT plugin in IDEA during the install process.
- I recommend using git bash when executing sbt commands, but who knows maybe powershell is fine too. I wouldn't know.

### OSX

- Java: `brew cask install java`
- Set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. [This might be helpful?](http://www.baeldung.com/java-home-on-windows-7-8-10-mac-os-x-linux)
- SBT (build automation tool): `brew install sbt`
- You will need an editor. I highly recommend Intellij's [IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIn7_C49LU1wIVE5AYCh18cgFkEAAYASABEgLXw_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds.ds&dclid=CNSNt-TS1NcCFReAmgodkS0Ojg#section=mac). *Seriously, trust me on this, if you want something intellisense-likey, there's almost no other option for an editor.*
- Install the Scala/SBT plugin in IDEA during the install process.

## Step Two: Build the thing and run the Test(s)

1. Open the Edit Configurations Menu
![Config Menu](/readme_images/EditRunConfigurations.png?raw=true "Configuarion Menu")
2. Create a new SBT Task
3. Define the Test Task as such. This task will run continuously and reload when it detects code changes.
4. Define the Run task as such. This task will run continuously and reload when it detects code changes.
5. Both tasks can be stopped at any time by using the stop button on the top-right of IDEA. 

## Step Three: Some Basic Terminology
