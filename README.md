#Getting Started With Scala and Functional Programming

##Step One: Get the tools.

###Windows

- [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html)
- The build automation tool: [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html). Make sure that you add it to your `$PATH`
- Set your JAVA_HOME environment variable: [confluence](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/setting-the-java_home-variable-in-windows-8895.html)
- You will need an editor. I highly recommend Intellij's [IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwru2stDU1wIV3cqyCh1ZSQCzEAAYASABEgIRbvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds.ds&dclid=CLjSu97Q1NcCFVGTGAodGz0OnA#section=windows). *Seriously, trust me on this, if you want something intellisense-likey, there's almost no other option for an editor.*
- I recommend using git bash when executing sbt commands, but who knows maybe powershell is fine too. I wouldn't know.

###OSX

- Java: `brew cask install java`
- Set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. [This might be helpful?](http://www.baeldung.com/java-home-on-windows-7-8-10-mac-os-x-linux)
- SBT (build automation tool): `brew install sbt`
- You will need an editor. I highly recommend Intellij's [IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIn7_C49LU1wIVE5AYCh18cgFkEAAYASABEgLXw_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds.ds&dclid=CNSNt-TS1NcCFReAmgodkS0Ojg#section=mac). *Seriously, trust me on this, if you want something intellisense-likey, there's almost no other option for an editor.*
