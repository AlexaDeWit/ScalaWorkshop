    //We'll find that, still, we get no action on the console. Maybe this is why people always say it's hard to "do anything"
    //in haskell.... so far we're "describing" the doing all day, hell, we can map actions to other actions, compose them all day.
    
    //Uncomment the line below, lets make it run the unsafe way, shall we?
